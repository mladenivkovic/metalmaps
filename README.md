Installation
------------------

Install this package via pip:

```bash
pip install metalmaps
```

Alternatively, grab the source from [github](https://github.com/mladenivkovic/metalmaps).


Usage
-------

To use these, you can import them and use them
with matplotlib as you would with any other color map.

```python
from metalmaps import black_sabbath
from matplotlib.pyplot import imshow
from numpy import random

imshow(random.rand(128, 128), cmap=black_sabbath)
```

The color maps can also be accessed in matplotlib using strings
by prefixing `metalmaps`, e.g.

```python
import metalmaps

imshow(random.rand(128, 128), cmap="metalmaps.red")
```


### Using a colormap as default line colors in plots

It's possible to replace the default matplotlib color cycle with one
provided by this package. To achieve this, call the provided
`metalmaps.set_color_cycle()` function, and pass the colormap you 
want as the argument, e.g:

```python
import metalmaps
metalmaps.set_color_cycle(metalmaps.reign_in_blood)
```

For example, this code

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

import metalmaps
metalmaps.set_color_cycle(metalmaps.reign_in_blood)

x = np.linspace(0, 1.4, 200)
def y(x, phi):
    return np.sin(1.2 * np.pi * (x + 0.25) - 0.1 * phi)

plt.figure()

for i in range(10):
    labelname = "C"+str(i)
    plt.plot(x, y(x, i), linewidth=5, label=labelname)

plt.legend(ncols=2)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("my_figure.png")

```

results in the following figure:

where we didn't have to specify the different colors each time we
called ``plot()``.

Note
----

Of course, these aren't necessarily designed to be colorblind
friendly, or perceptually uniform, so use them with caution.
They are fun though. To underline how much you should
_not_ use these in a real scientific publication (apart from
perhaps qualitative imaging), the lightness values are shown
below.

![](images/lightness.png)

For quantitative comparisons, please ensure that you use a
perceptually uniform colour map (see e.g. those available
directly through [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.7.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html)).




Contributing
------------

Yes please! It would be grand to collect even more album art colormaps.

Intstructions:

+ generate your color palette any way you please, and add it to `colors.py`
+ instantiate the matplotlib colormap in `__init__.py`
+ add your addition to the album lists in `README.md` and `__init__.py`
+ submit your merge request
+ ???
+ profit!
